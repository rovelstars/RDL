## Note:

We don't care about other's to setup their own list, and we will not tolerate any questions asked about how to setup your own instance of the list. But if you think there's some problem with our code which won't run on vps or other places, please do let us know.

Please keep bugs, issues and everything related to the code in our issues and pull requests. Taking them to our discord server will be **IGNORED**. The website feedback looks for your likes and dislikes on the front end as well as suggestions, but not for fixes or problems. Please bring them here if you really want help/to help.

This project is open sourced for allowing us to be transparent in our work, and to prove that we are good. If you're trying to setup it, please do so only if you're testing it or helping us.
If you're running it publicly, as a self deployment, make sure to let us know about your website link in our support server.

> Thank you for your time and love that made us make this possible!
